#summary Torberry main info

= Introduction =
Torberry is a raspbian based Linux distribution ready to serve as a transparent proxy and DNS server. Can work with of without physical isolation.

= Details =
Main features:
 * Raspbian based
 * includes minimal packages + tor + tor-arm + dropbear
 * includes a web server based on cherrypy

= Installation =
Torberry is installed as usual in Raspberry. You can read [http://code.google.com/p/torberry/wiki/Installation installation instructions]

= Clients configuration =
physical-isolation (requires an additional usb interface):
Client just connect with dhcp enable and obtain an IP on the downstream side.

nonphys (default):
Client configuratiÃ³n must be done manually. Two things that you have to change are gateway and dns servers. Both must be configured with raspberry's IP.

In Linux you can:
{{{
sudo route delete default gateway [your.current.gateway]
sudo route add default gateway [ip.of.raspberry]
sudo echo "nameserver [ip.of.raspberry]" > /etc/resolv.conf
}}}

= Unsupported protocols =
As this is basically a transparent + DNS proxy, there are network protocols that wont work as you would expect in a gateway.

*ICMP* is not supported by tor.
*UDP* is not supported by tor.
